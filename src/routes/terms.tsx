          <Section title="1. About These Terms">
            <p>
              These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Thoth, a WhatsApp-native food
              ordering platform operated by Thoth Technologies ("we", "us", "our"). Thoth connects
              restaurants in Ghana with customers who order food via WhatsApp.
            </p>
            <p>
              By creating a restaurant account, placing an order, or otherwise using any part of the
              Thoth platform, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of Ghana, including the Electronic
              Transactions Act, 2008 (Act 772) and the Data Protection Act, 2012 (Act 843).
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="2. Who These Terms Apply To">
            <p>These Terms apply to two types of users:</p>
            <Ul>
              <li>
                <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Restaurants</strong> — businesses
                that sign up to list their menu and receive orders through Thoth. Restaurants access
                the platform via the web dashboard at app.thothaigh.com.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Customers</strong> — individuals
                who browse menus and place orders via WhatsApp. Customers do not need to create an
                account.
              </li>
            </Ul>
            <p>Additional terms specific to each user type are set out in sections 5 and 6 below.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="3. The Thoth Platform">
            <p>
              Thoth is a WhatsApp-native commerce platform. We enable restaurants to list their
              menus and receive orders via WhatsApp, and we enable customers to discover and order
              food from a variety of restaurants — all without leaving their WhatsApp chat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where delivery is offered, Thoth Technologies facilitates the logistics process,
              coordinating delivery of orders from the restaurant to the customer. However, delivery
              is subject to availability in the customer's area, and we reserve the right to
              determine delivery zones and timelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              The restaurant is solely responsible for the preparation, quality, and accuracy of
              the food. Thoth Technologies is not liable for any issues arising from food quality
              or preparation.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="4. Platform Fees">
            <p>Thoth operates on two pricing tiers:</p>
            <Ul>
              <li>
                <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Free plan</strong> — restaurants
                pay no monthly fee. A small platform service fee is added to each customer order at
                checkout. This fee is clearly disclosed to the customer before payment is confirmed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Pro plan</strong> — restaurants
                pay a flat monthly subscription fee (GHS 199/month at the time of writing, subject
                to change with 30 days' notice). No per-order platform fee is charged to customers
                on this plan.
              </li>
            </Ul>
            <p>
              Thoth Technologies reserves the right to change pricing with 30 days' written notice
              to affected restaurants via email or in-app notification.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="5. Restaurant Terms">
            <Sub title="5.1 Account Registration">
              <p>
                To list your restaurant on Thoth you must create an account and complete the
                onboarding process, including connecting a WhatsApp number (your own number on the
                Pro plan, or the shared Thoth number on the Free plan), uploading your menu, and
                connecting a Paystack merchant account for payment processing.
              </p>
              <p>
                You must provide accurate, current, and complete information. You are responsible
                for maintaining the security of your account credentials.
              </p>
            </Sub>
            <Sub title="5.2 Menu and Pricing">
              <p>
                You are responsible for ensuring your menu items, descriptions, photos, and prices
                are accurate and up to date. Prices listed on the platform must match the prices you
                charge for the same items in person. You may not use the platform to charge customers
                more than your in-person prices.
              </p>
            </Sub>
            <Sub title="5.3 Order Fulfilment">
              <p>
                Once a customer places and pays for an order, you are obligated to fulfil that order
                promptly and accurately. If you are unable to fulfil an order (for example, due to
                item unavailability), you must notify the customer promptly via WhatsApp and issue a
                refund where applicable. Repeated failures to fulfil confirmed, paid orders may result
                in deprecation or reduction of trust score and ultimately suspension or termination of account.
              </p>
            </Sub>
            <Sub title="5.4 Payments and Payouts">
              <p>
                Payments from customers are processed by Paystack, a licensed payment service
                provider. Paystack processing fees are borne by the customer and are not deducted
                from your earnings. Your earnings are calculated as follows:
              </p>
              <Ul>
                <li>
                  <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Pro plan</strong> — your
                  earnings equal the full order value. No platform fee or commission is deducted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Free plan</strong> — your
                  earnings equal the order value minus the Thoth platform commission, which is added
                  to the customer's checkout total and retained by Thoth Technologies.
                </li>
              </Ul>
              <p>
                Earnings from paid online orders are credited to your Thoth merchant wallet on a
                T+1 basis — the next business day following order completion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Withdrawals to your registered MoMo account are instant and require no approval or
                request — your balance is available to you immediately at any time.
              </p>
            </Sub>
            <Sub title="5.5 Cash on Delivery (COD)">
              <p>
                If you enable Cash on Delivery, customers may select this option at checkout. COD
                orders are not pre-paid. You accept the risk of non-payment on COD orders. Thoth
                Technologies is not liable for unpaid COD orders.

                <li>
                  Attempt to circumvent the platform by directing customers to pay you directly

            <Sub title="6.1 Ordering">
              <p>
                When you place an order via WhatsApp, you are entering into a contract with the
                restaurant, not with Thoth Technologies. We facilitate the order and payment but are
                not a party to the food purchase itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                By confirming an order and completing payment, you agree to pay the total amount
                shown, including any applicable platform service fee (on Free-plan restaurants) and
                Paystack processing fee.
              </p>
            </Sub>
            <Sub title="6.2 Refunds and Cancellations">
              <p>
                Once an order is confirmed and payment is processed, cancellations are at the
                restaurant's discretion. If a restaurant is unable to fulfil your order, you are
                entitled to a full refund of the amount paid. Refunds are processed via Paystack and
                may take 3–5 business days to reflect in your account or MoMo wallet.

            </Sub>
            <Sub title="6.3 Disputes">
              <p>
                If you have an issue with an order (wrong items, missing items, food quality), please
                raise a dispute through the Thoth platform within 24 hours of receiving your order.
                We will mediate between you and the restaurant in good faith. Our dispute resolution
                decisions are final within the platform but do not affect your statutory rights under
                Ghanaian consumer protection law.

          <Section title="7. Intellectual Property">
            <p>
              Thoth, the Thoth logo, and all platform software and content are the property of Thoth
              Technologies. Restaurants retain ownership of their own menu content (photos,
              descriptions, prices) but grant Thoth Technologies a licence to display that content on
              the platform for the purpose of operating the service.

          <Section title="8. Limitation of Liability">
            <p>
              To the fullest extent permitted by Ghanaian law, Thoth Technologies is not liable for:
            </p>
            <Ul>
              <li>The quality, safety, or fitness of any food ordered through the platform</li>

            <p>
              Our total liability to any user for any claim arising from use of the platform shall
              not exceed the total fees paid by that user to Thoth Technologies in the 3 months
              preceding the claim.

          <Section title="9. Termination">
            <p>
              We may suspend or terminate any restaurant account at any time if we reasonably believe
              the account is being used in breach of these Terms, or if the restaurant repeatedly
              fails to fulfil paid orders. We will provide notice where possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Restaurants may close their account at any time. Any outstanding wallet balance is
              available for instant withdrawal before or at the time of account closure, minus any
              amounts owed to Thoth Technologies.

          <Section title="10. Changes to These Terms">
            <p>
              We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify restaurants of material
              changes via email or in-app notification at least 14 days before they take effect.
              Continued use of the platform after that date constitutes acceptance of the updated
              Terms.
